## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

This project made me learn how to use localStorage to store information/data and how to set it also. It also enhanced some of my basic JavaScript skills like conditional statements and use of functions


```js
one.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
        btn = one.value;
        window.localStorage.setItem("number", btn)
})
```

### Continued development

I still have to practice with localStorage to be able to perfect it. Also looking forward to practice using JavaScript to create effects on a website.
